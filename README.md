# AutomotivePartData
Scraping autopart data from RockAuto

TODO/Missing:

Removed proxy implementation code for the moment
Sub-cat and part code does not have implementation for checking already scraped code (should be able to just compare url's present in sub-cat or parts to see if that part has been scraped or not)
Search feature to only scrape parts by specific priority manufacturers
